# Task Manager

This application is written in java, using the spring framework, and persists data using hibernate and a postgres database. The application is organized to be modular using layers (separating business logic from data access, and the REST layer). There are also Javadocs on methods. In addition to the create and delete operations, I have added an API to provide user auth. User passwords are saved as bcrypt password hashes. I have written controller tests to show knowledge of MockMVC and JUnit.
